1) Write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply the  resultant value by 5. Display the final result.(Using Assignment Operators)

2) Greatest of four numbers using nested ternary operator

3) Consider the following code snippet:
   int i = 10;
   int n = i++%5;
  i) What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
  ii)What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?
